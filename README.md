# Python: Basic to Professional 🐍

A comprehensive Python learning repository designed to take you from fundamental concepts to advanced programming techniques. This structured course covers everything from variables and basic syntax to GUI development and Data Structures & Algorithms.

## 📚 Overview

This repository provides a complete learning path for Python programming, organized into sequential lectures with practical exercises. Each lecture combines theoretical concepts with hands-on practice to reinforce learning.

## 🎯 Learning Path

The course is organized into 25 lectures, progressing from basic to advanced concepts:

### Fundamentals (Lectures 1-5)
- **Lecture 1**: Introduction to Python, Variables, and Data Types
- **Lecture 2**: Input/Output Operations
- **Lecture 3**: Operators and Expressions
- **Lecture 4**: Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
- **Lecture 5**: Loops (for, while)

### Intermediate Concepts (Lectures 6-15)
- **Lecture 6**: Lists and List Operations
- **Lecture 7**: Tuples
- **Lecture 8**: Sets
- **Lecture 9**: Dictionaries
- **Lecture 10**: Strings and String Methods
- **Lecture 11**: Functions
- **Lecture 12**: Lambda Functions and Higher-Order Functions
- **Lecture 13**: Modules and Packages
- **Lecture 14**: File Handling
- **Lecture 15**: Exception Handling

### Advanced Topics (Lectures 16-25)
- **Lecture 16**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
- **Lecture 17**: OOP - Inheritance
- **Lecture 18**: OOP - Polymorphism
- **Lecture 19**: OOP - Encapsulation and Abstraction
- **Lecture 20**: Iterators and Generators
- **Lecture 21**: Decorators
- **Lecture 22**: Regular Expressions
- **Lecture 23**: Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Lecture 24**: GUI Development with Tkinter
- **Lecture 25**: Advanced Projects and Best Practices

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor)
- Basic computer literacy

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sohamexe-tech/Python-Basic-to-professional.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Python-Basic-to-professional
```

3. Start with Lecture 1:
```bash
cd Lecture1
```

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

Each lecture folder contains:
- **Theory files**: Explaining the concepts covered in that lecture
- **Practical exercises**: Hands-on coding problems to practice
- **Example code**: Reference implementations

### Recommended Learning Approach

1. **Sequential Learning**: Follow the lectures in order (Lecture 1 → Lecture 25)
2. **Theory First**: Read through the theoretical content in each lecture
3. **Practice**: Complete the practical exercises (named as `l[number]p[number].py`)
4. **Code Along**: Try implementing concepts on your own before checking solutions
5. **Review**: Revisit previous lectures if needed to reinforce understanding

### Naming Convention
Files are named using the pattern: `l[lecture_number]p[practical_number]`
- `l` = Lecture
- `p` = Practical

Example: `l1p1.py` = Lecture 1, Practical 1

## 🎓 Course Highlights

- ✅ **Structured Learning**: Progressive difficulty from basics to advanced
- ✅ **Hands-on Practice**: Multiple practical exercises per lecture
- ✅ **Complete Coverage**: From syntax to GUI and DSA
